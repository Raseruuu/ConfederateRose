    "The air was cold, June felt the snowflakes touch his skin, but he was so cold they didn’t even melt."
    "It was not his first time in England but he was amazed at the white snow that covered the streets."
    "June knew for fact that those flakes weren't natural and that amidst the peace they gave to him, they were silently deadly. Human time on earth was reaching its end."
    "Since the atmosphere became so polluted with carbon dioxide and other gases, humans can no longer reproduce normally. The new human generation was created."
    "On the verge of extinction, old scientists discovered a way to create humans on labs."
    "These humans are special, they are custom made. The skin color, the hair, the eyes, the personality, everything you desire on a child is possible, for a price."
    "June walked towards the airport Exit. Absorbed in his thoughts."
    "When he finally got out of that mess, he jumped on those fancy new self-driving eco cars that the British implemented a few years ago. He paid his fee and selected where he wanted to go, for a moment, he was free."
    "The ride towards the university was very fast, he didn’t even notice anything because after a few blocks he was fast asleep."
    "He stepped out of the car, took his luggage and walked to the building’s entrance. There was a big wooden sign on the outer wall that read: “Agnes Arber Dormitory”. He proceeded to the reception where he registered with his foreign ID."
    "He went up the old, wooden and squeaky steps towards his room in the 6th floor... At the end of such hike, he was exhausted, so he just collapsed on his bed and closed his eyes for a moment, or so he thought."
    "He suddenly felt like he was being watched from behind…"
    "He turned around just in time to see a shadow disappear by the door. He didn’t have the chance to look at it with detail. He was so scared that he locked the door and went to sleep."
    
    "*Day 1*"
    
    "I wake up by mere coincidence, didn’t even set an alarm or anything. Weird, i thought i didn’t sleep at all but it seems fatigue kicked in at last."
    "I am all settled in, just finished unpacking the things that I had on my suitcase and placed them on the only drawer the little room had. Just beside the pink duvet of the bed."
    "I go to the bathroom and take a shower. I see a hair dryer hanging in it’s holder."
    j "Hm… it’s weird that my room has a hair dryer. That is some quality appliances for the price I pay for this room."
    "Suddenly i hear someone knock on the door, and as i'm just getting out of the shower, just with a  towel on. I approach the door and proceed to open it."
    "There is an old lady at the other side, i'm kinda surprised but at the same time i'm just as embarrassed."
    ol "Just how indecent are women today! Cover yourself girl! I don’t care how flat chested you are, it is simply not right to open the door without a shirt!"
    "I'm confused."
    "I close the door as fast as I can and grab the first shirt I find in my room and just place it in front of me."
    ol "Now, now. I’m just visiting my new tenant, it is not an inspection for now, just remember that a proper lady must be visible at all times!"
    "I'm still as confused as before."
    "With that the Old lady turns around and leaves my room. I check the clock. 6:45. I’m running late for my first class!. I brush my teeth hastily and run half dressed to the hall."
    "I’m paralyzed at my room’s entrance."
    "There is only girls at my floor not a single boy to be seen. I don’t know what to do so I just walk pass some sleepy looking girls and take the stairs to the first level." 
    "While i'm at it, i glimpse at a white haired girl gazing at my direction fixedly, maybe i’ve been exposed?." 
    "She simply turns around and lets me escape the maelstrom."
    "It takes a 15 minutes walk to get to campus. It is an old looking building, it has a cliche looking main entrance with cherry trees on both sides, sadly it's winter so they do not have any leaves."
    "I walk into class and proceed to take a sit on the last row, near the window because I like feeling the wind in  my skin."
    "Not even 5 minutes go by when a crowd of students flood the room and take their places."
    "For a moment, i’m frozen in time, the same girl from this morning is moving in my direction."
    "Panic."
    "She walks the distance there is from the door to my place and proceeds to take a sit just at my side. I don't know yet, but i think I just dodged a bullet."
    "Class is just as boring as expected, so I feel relieved when the bell rings. I proceed to stand up and walk towards the class exit, but someone stands in front of me and doesn't let me get to it."
    u "Hi I don’t believe i’ve introduced myself, i'm Rose, your neighbor. Pleased to meet you."
    j "Hi, my name is June, I moved in yesterday to your apartment complex and it looks like we are on the same… class."
    "I don’t even remember the name of the class we’d just recieved so I space out for a moment there, enough time for her to notice."
    "She chuckles a little bit when I try to remember the name of the course."
    r "You seem kinda lost, Are you alright?, Maybe I can walk with you back to the dormitories."
    j "Don't you think it will be weird?"
    r "What do you mean? We girls should protect each other backs."
    "I see now, I was mistaken as a girl and put in the girls dorm. A foolish mistake, but I can not back down now, I have to keep my facade."
